# Introduction to Harems

Harems is a collection of 10,000 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs);
each NFT is a unique digital collectible of Harem Girls covering
235 countries around the world that exist on the Ethereum blockchain.

Within those 10,000 unique NFTs – there is one unique Harem Girl
per country in one of 10 different positions.

Each Harem Girl will have traits from various standard categories including
country, position, type of girl, hair color, hair style, hair accessories,
background color, logo color, top clothes, bottom clothes, clothes color,
shoe color and more.

In addition to standard traits - each girl type i.e. sugar baby etc will have
unique traits that can be unlocked. An example would be only escorts can be
found dead and only a trophy wife gets diamonds. Countries who have large numbers
of Muslims will have the ability to get some women with face coverings whereas
countries with large numbers of Christians unlock the ability to have nuns. Each
country is able to have a maximum of one super rare trait; for example - one Saudi
girl will have a picture of Osama Bin Laden in her room whereas one Japanese girl
will have a picture of Pat Morina. All of these traits are randomly selected using
random equations.

All Harem girls will be distributed on IPFS to ensure their life cycle.
Ownership of any Harem girl NFT will grant access to the Gentleman’s Club;
future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community with roadmap activation.
